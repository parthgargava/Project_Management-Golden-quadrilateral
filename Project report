INTRODUCTION


The Golden Quadrilateral is a highway network connecting India's four metropolitan cities:   Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai thus forming a quadrilateral of sorts connecting the main Indian cities.
Four other cities among the top ten metropolises: Bangalore, Pune, Ahmedabad, and Surat, are also served by the network, which connects many of the major industrial, agricultural and cultural centers of India.
It is the largest highway project in India and the fifth longest in the world[, it is the first phase of the National Highways Development Project (NHDP), and consists of building 5,846 km (3,633 mile) four/six lane express highways. The project was launched in 2001.
The total cost of the project is  600 billion which equals US$11 billion.
The Golden Quadrilateral project is managed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) under the Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways.














HISTORY AND COSTS


The foundation stone of the project was laid on 6 January 1999 by then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
In January 2012, the completion of the four lane Golden Quadrilateral was announced.
India's government had initially estimated that the Golden Quadrilateral project would cost  600 billion (US$11 billion) at 1999 prices.
However, the highway has been built under-budget.
As of August 2011, cost incurred by Indian government was about half of initial estimate, at  308.58 billion (US$5.6 billion).
In September 2009, it was announced that the existing four-laned highways would be converted into six-lane highways.




















ROUTE

Only National Highways are used in the Golden Quadrilateral. The four legs use the following National Highways:
•	Delhi – Kolkata: NH 2
•	Delhi – Mumbai: NH 8, NH 79A, NH 79, NH 76, NH 8.
•	Mumbai –Chennai: NH 4, NH 7, NH 46, NH 4.
•	Kolkata – Chennai: NH 6, NH 60, NH 5.


STATES COVERED
The completed Golden Quadrilateral passes through 13 States of India:
•	Andhra Pradesh – 1,014 km (630 mi)
•	Uttar Pradesh – 756 km (470 mi)
•	Rajasthan – 725 km (450 mi)
•	Karnataka – 623 km (387 mi)
•	Maharashtra – 487 km (303 mi)
•	Gujarat – 485 km (301 mi)
•	Odisha – 440 km (270 mi)
•	West Bengal – 406 km (252 mi)
•	Tamil Nadu – 342 km (213 mi)
•	Bihar – 204 km (127 mi)
•	Jharkhand – 192 km (119 mi)
•	Haryana – 152 km (94 mi)
•	Delhi – 25 km (16 mi)
Total – 5,846 km (3,633 miles)


PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT
The project is composed of following phases:-
PHASE 1
The golden quadrilateral connecting the four major cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. This project connecting four metro cities would be 5846 Km. Total cost of the project is Rs. 300 billion (USD 6.8 billion). 
PHASE 2
North-south and east-west corridors comprising NH’s connecting four extreme points of the country. Total length of the network is 7300 Km as of January 2009. 42% of the project has been completed and 44% of the project work is currently in progress. It also includes port connectivity and other projects.
PHASE 3
The government recently approved NHDP-III to upgrade 12109km of NH on a build operate and transfer (BOT)basis, which take into account high density traffic, connectivity of state capital via NHDP phase I and phase II, and connectivity to centers of economic importance contracts have been awarded for a 2075km
PHASE 4
The government is considering widening 20,000km of highway that were not part of phase I , II or III . Phase IV will convert existing lane highways into two lanes with paved shoulders. 





PHASE 5

As road traffic increases over time a number of 4 lane highways will need to be expanded to 6 lanes. The current learn calls for upgrade of about 5000 km of four lane roads.
PHASE 6
The goverment is working on constructing expressways that would connect major commercial and industrial locations. It has already identified 400 km of Vadodara (earlier Baroda)- Mumbai section that would connect to the existing Vadodara- Ahmadabad section. The project will be funded on BOT basis.
PHASE 7
This phase call for improvements to city road networks by adding ring roads to enable easier connectivity with national highways to important cities. In addition, improvements will be made to stretches of national highways that requires additional flyovers and by-passes given population and housing growth along the highways and increasing traffic.

ECONOMIC BENEFITS

   The projected economic benefits of the GOLDEN QUADRILATERAL project are 
1.	Establishing faster transport networks between major cities and ports.
2.	Providing an impetus to smoother movement of products and people within India.
3.	Enabling industrial and job development in smaller towns through access to markets.
4.	Providing opportunities for farmers, through better transportation of produce from the agricultural hinterland to major cities and ports for export, through lesser wastage and spoils.
5.	Driving economic growth directly, through construction as well as through indirect demand for cement, steel and other construction materials.
6.	Giving an impetus to Truck transport throughout India.

PROBLEMS FACED

Projects have been delayed mainly due to problems associated with land acquisition, shifting of utilities, obtaining environment and forest clearance, approval for road over bridges, poor performance of some contractors due to cash flow constraints and law and order problems in some states.

FUTURE PLANS

The Indian government has set ambitious plans for upgrading the national highways             in a phased manner in the years to come. The details are as follows 
•	4-laning of 10,000 km (NHDP phase III) including 4000km that has been already   approved. An accelerated road development programme for the North Eastern region.
•	2-laning with paved shoulders of 20,000km of national highways under NHDP phase  IV
•	6-laning of GQ and some other selected stretches covering 6500km under NHDP phase V.
•	Development of 1000km of expressways under NHDP phaseVI
•	Development of ring roads, by-passes, great separators, service roads etc. Under NHDP phase VII.
